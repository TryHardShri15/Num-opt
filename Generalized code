# Example usage: 
# Defining a Finite Automaton with states, transitions, and final states

# States are numbered, and 'final states' are the accepting ones
initial_state = 1
final_states = {2}  # Final state is 2, meaning it accepts if it ends in state 2
transition_function = {
    (1, 'b'): 1,  # From state 1, on 'b' it stays in state 1
    (1, 'a'): 2,  # From state 1, on 'a' it transitions to state 2
    (2, 'b'): 1,  # From state 2, on 'b' it goes back to state 1
    (2, 'a'): 3,  # From state 2, on 'a' it goes to state 3 (which is a rejecting state)
    (3, 'a'): 3,  # State 3 stays in state 3 for both 'a' and 'b'
    (3, 'b'): 3,
}

# Creating the FA object
fa = FiniteAutomaton(initial_state, final_states, transition_function)

# Testing with some strings
fa.process('abbb')  # Should print accepted or rejected based on the transitions
fa.process('aabb')  # Should print accepted or rejected
